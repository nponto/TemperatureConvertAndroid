## How to Use

Temperature Converter uses a textbox that the user can enter a value into. Once a value is entered, the user can choose between converting that value
from Celcius to Fahrenheit using the "C to F" button, or Fahrenheit to Celcius using the "F to C" button. Once clicked, the app will load a new page
with the resulting temperature conversion.
